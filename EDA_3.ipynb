But you can go for it if you have a tight budget.,Initial impressions: works as said, glad I didn’t go for cheaper options (not that it’s too costly) just plug and play. Will update if it screws up,The hdmi cable is good to watch movie,sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with TV and play 🎮.I loved it,Works as expected.

              "If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,This is worth for price , has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage , ofcourse it has configuration less so we should not look better than thisBattery life more than expected, we could buy for this budget range,Simple and good, ok camera,Ok,Overall good quality product,Good unit,Good,Good mobile for basic users                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1255336.0\n",
              "The sound quality of this earphone are really good. The bass part was also good. I only found the noise cancellation was not what I expected. It could be much better.

              "I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity     539074.0\n",
              "I haven’t used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance. Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,👍,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I'm very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others.

Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would've been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it's a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               513244.0\n",

              "I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        307957.0\n",

Will update if it screws up,The hdmi cable is good to watch movie,sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with TV and play 🎮.I loved it,Works as expected.

When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this.

I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others.
